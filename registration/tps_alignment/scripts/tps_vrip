# Sample script for running pvrip on aligned data
#
# The script creates a vrip subdirectory of the current directory,
# puts reoriented versions of all .ply files in the current directory
# into it, then runs pvrip.
#
# An optional argument is the name of the loadlimit file for loadbalance,
# otherwise one is created.
#
# Any parameters to pvrip must be changed in the script itself.
